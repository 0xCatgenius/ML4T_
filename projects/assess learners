Implement and evaluate four CART regression algorithms in object-oriented Python: a “classic” Decision Tree learner, a Random Tree learner, a Bootstrap Aggregating learner (i.e, a “bag learner”), and an Insane Learner. As regression learners, the goal for your learner is to return a continuous numerical result (not a discrete result). You will use techniques introduced in the course lectures. However, this project may require readings or additional research to ensure an understanding of supervised learning, linear regression, learner performance, performance metrics, and CARTs (i.e., decision trees).
